Python Essentials | Jan 2021 Batch 2

Assignment 3 | 21st January 2021


Question 1

Write a Python program to merge two files into a third file.

Code:
# Python program to 
# demonstrate merging 
# of two files 
  
data = data2 = "" 
  
# Reading data from file1 
with open('file1.txt') as fp: 
    data = fp.read() 
  
# Reading data from file2 
with open('file2.txt') as fp: 
    data2 = fp.read() 
  
# Merging 2 files 
# To add the data of file2 
# from next line 
data += "\n"
data += data2 
  
with open ('file3.txt', 'w') as fp: 
    fp.write(data) 
    
Question 2

Take two lists as input list1 = [1,2,3,4,5] and list2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] From that make a
dictionary ouput {1:"a", 2:"b", 3:"c", 4:"d", 5:"e"}

# Python3 code to demonstrate  
# conversion of lists to dictionary 
# using naive method 
  
# initializing lists 
test_keys = [1,2,3,4,5] 
test_values = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] 
  
# Printing original keys-value lists 
print ("Original key list is : " + str(test_keys)) 
print ("Original value list is : " + str(test_values)) 
  
# using naive method 
# to convert lists to dictionary 
res = {} 
for key in test_keys: 
    for value in test_values: 
        res[key] = value 
        test_values.remove(value) 
        break  
  
# Printing resultant dictionary  
print ("Resultant dictionary is : " +  str(res))
