Assignment 1 | 19th January 2021

Question 1 
Write a Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval. 

Code:
# Python program to print all
# prime number in an interval
#number should be greater than 1
start = 11
end = 25
 
for i in range(start,end):
  if i>1:
    for j in range(2,i):
        if(i % j==0):
            break
    else:
        print(i)
Output:
11
13
17
19
23




Question 2 
Write a Python Program for factorial of a number. 

Code:
# Python 3 program to find 
# factorial of given number
def factorial(n):
      
    # single line to find factorial
    return 1 if (n==1 or n==0) else n * factorial(n - 1); 
  
# Driver Code
num = 5;
print("Factorial of",num,"is",
factorial(num))
Output:
Factorial of 5 is 120








Question 3 
Find the sum of n numbers by using the while loop

Code:
# Sum of natural numbers up to num

num = 16

if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero
   while(num > 0):
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("The sum is", sum)
Output:
The sum is 136
