Assignment 2 | 20th January 2021

Question 1
Write a Python program to remove empty List from List.

Code:

# Python3 code to demonstrate  
# Remove empty List from List 
# using list comprehension 
  
# Initializing list  
test_list = [5, 6, [], 3, [], [], 9] 
  
# printing original list  
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list)) 
  
# Remove empty List from List 
# using filter 
res = list(filter(None, test_list)) 
  
# printing result  
print ("List after empty list removal : " + str(res)) 

Output:
The original list is : [5, 6, [], 3, [], [], 9]
List after empty list removal : [5, 6, 3, 9]


Question 2
Write a Python program to remove all duplicates words from a given sentence

#Input : Python is great and Java is also great
#Output : is also Java Python and great

# Program without using any external library 
s = "Python is great and Java is also great"
l = s.split() 
k = [] 
for i in l: 
  
    # If condition is used to store unique string  
    # in another list 'k'  
    if (s.count(i)>1 and (i not in k)or s.count(i)==1): 
        k.append(i) 
print(' '.join(k)) 

Output:
Python is great and Java also

Question 3
Write a Python program to find all occurrences of a character in the given string

Code:
# Python3 code to demonstrate  
# occurrence frequency using  
# count() 
  
# initializing string  
test_str = "python programming"
  
# using count() to get count  
# counting e  
counter = test_str.count('p') 
  
# printing result  
print ("Count of p in Python Programming is : "
                           +  str(counter)) 
 
 Output:
 Count of p in Python Programming is : 2
